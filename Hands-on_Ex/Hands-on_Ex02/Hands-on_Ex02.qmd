In this hands-on exercise, several ggplot2 extensions will be used for creating more elegant and effective statistical graphics. By the end of the exercise, you will be able to:

-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in [ggrepel](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/) package,
-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in [ggthemes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) and [hrbrthemes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hrbrthemes/index.html) packages,
-   plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using [patchwork](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/index.html) package.
