About this site

![](images/th.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

This website is created with the purpose of detailing the "destinations" in the voyage of ISSS608 - Visual Analytics and Applications module, part of the SMU MITB programme, AY2023-24.

Many thanks to captain, Prof. Kam Tin Seong, in navigating us through the world of Visual Analytics.
