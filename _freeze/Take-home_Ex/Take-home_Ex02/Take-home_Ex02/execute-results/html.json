The submission was assessed in terms of both clarity and aesthetics, and a sketch of an alternative DataViz design was prepared using data visualisation design principles and best practices learnt in first 2 lessons. The alternative design was next implemented using R ggplot2, ggplot2 extensions and tidyverse packages.\n\n# 2 Getting started\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.1 Loading R packages\n\nThe¬†`pacman::p_load()`¬†function is used to install and load the required R packages into the R environment, as below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, ggrepel, patchwork, ggplot2, \n               ggthemes, hrbrthemes, dplyr, tidyr, knitr, ggridges, ggdist, ggstance)\n```\n:::\n\n\nCompared to the original submission, these 2 additional package were loaded:\n\n-   [ggdist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdist/): an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats for visualising distributions and uncertainties\n-   [ggstance](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/ggstance.html): an R paclage that extends ggplot2 and provides the horizontal versions of ggplot2 geoms\n\n## 2.2 **Importing PISA data**\n\nTo reproduce the steps used in the original submission in preparing the dataset, the following code chunk uses the [`read_sas()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_sas.html)¬†of¬†[haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/)¬†to import PISA data into R environment.\n\n\n:::

{.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstu_qqq_SG <- stu_qqq %>%\n  filter(CNT == \"SGP\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nSaving the records belonging to Singapore students into ‚Äústu_qqq_SG.rds‚Äù file for easier loading (no need to extract the records from the entire dataset repeatedly).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite_rds(stu_qqq_SG,\n          \"data/stu_qqq_SG.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nLoading the

To similarly indicate these values on the plot, a better approach will be to use a box plot, which can provide more quantile values for analysis. |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| [**Aesthetics**]{.underline}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| a.  üíö Title position on the chart is aligned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| b.  üíö Use of different \"soft\" colours for different domains on different plots helps to make the plots less dull.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| c.  ‚ùå There seemed to be too much gridlines on the chart, which makes the chart area a bit busy.

{.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Improvements from the makeover:**\n\nClarity:\n\n-   Raincloud plot is used as it allows for both the density curve and boxplot used in the original submission to be placed on the same plot.\n-   Title and subtitle used to provide meaningful context for the plot, so that the audience can better make their own interpretations and form their own insights.\n-   Synchronised the y- and x-axis for all the plots for easier visual comparisons.\n-   The dot plot that is added provided additional perspectives, e.g. showing that the number of private school students is much smaller than that of public school students.\n\nAesthetics:\n\n-   Synchronised the x-axis for easier comparisons.\n-   Gridlines are removed since they are redundant in the raincloud plot.\n\n## 3.4 Makeover 4: **Performance and Socioeconomic Status**\n\nFor this makeover, the original focused more on the Math performance, hence I have used the Math performance for my makeover too.\n\n### 3.4.1 Original DataViz\n\n![](images/screenshot2-01.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### 3.4.2 Critique\n\nThe
